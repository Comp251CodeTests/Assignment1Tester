#if someone could test this branch and let me know wheter the expected results match what you are getting it would be great. If you do test it let me know so that I can merge to the main branch

# Assignment 1 Tester
## Don't share any of your code
Make sure that when you commit to this repo you don't include any of your code or solutions.

If your tester code has something that is not straight forward or needs more explaining feel free to add it here or in the code comments.
If you can avoid creating a new file for your specific tester (unless you are the first to post it) it would be great so that we have a single file for all tests. And make sure when adding a test that it is not already there.
